# Database Schema Improvements

This document outlines the major improvements made to the mbands-back database schema to enhance data integrity, performance, and maintainability.

## Overview of Changes

### 1. Enhanced Data Validation & Constraints

#### Band Entity
- Added length constraints for string fields (name: 255, genre: 100, country: 100)
- Added unique constraint on band name
- Added check constraint for `yearFormed` (must be between 1900 and current year)
- Added `description` and `imageUrl` fields
- Created composite index on `(genre, country)` for efficient filtering

#### Member Entity
- Fixed primary key decorator order
- Added `joinDate`, `leaveDate`, and `isActive` fields for better member lifecycle tracking
- Added `biography` field for member descriptions
- Extended instrument enum to include 'Other'
- Added proper foreign key constraint with CASCADE delete

#### Song Entity
- Added `duration` (in seconds), `trackNumber`, `lyrics`, and `videoUrl` fields
- Enhanced many-to-many relationship with Album entity
- Added index on `title` for search performance

#### Album Entity
- Added `description`, `coverImageUrl`, and `totalTracks` fields
- Improved length constraints on string fields
- Fixed many-to-many relationship with Song entity
- Added indexes on `releaseDate` and `genre`

#### User Entity
- Added `firstName`, `lastName`, `isActive`, and `lastLoginAt` fields
- Added unique constraints on `username` and `email`
- Enhanced length constraints and indexes for better performance

#### Role Entity
- Added `description` field
- Added unique constraint on role name

#### Event Entity
- Added comprehensive event details: `eventType`, `venue`, `city`, `country`
- Added `ticketPrice` and `ticketUrl` for ticketing information
- Added `isActive` field for event status management
- Created enum for event types (Concert, Festival, Tour, Recording, Interview, Other)
- Added indexes on `date` and `eventType`

### 2. Audit Trail Implementation

All entities now include:
- `createdAt`: Timestamp when record was created
- `updatedAt`: Timestamp when record was last modified
- `deletedAt`: Timestamp for soft deletion (nullable)

This enables:
- Complete audit trail of all data changes
- Soft deletion capabilities
- Better data governance and compliance

### 3. Database Indexes

Strategic indexes have been added for commonly queried fields:
- **Band**: Composite index on `(genre, country)`, individual indexes on `yearFormed` and `active`
- **Album**: Indexes on `releaseDate` and `genre`
- **Song**: Index on `title`
- **User**: Indexes on `username` and `email`
- **Event**: Indexes on `date` and `eventType`

### 4. Enhanced DTOs with Validation

All CreateDto classes now include comprehensive validation:
- String length validation
- Required field validation
- Type validation (integers, dates, URLs)
- Enum validation
- Range validation (e.g., year constraints)

#### Example: CreateBandDto
```typescript
export class CreateBandDto {
  @IsString()
  @IsNotEmpty()
  @Length(1, 255)
  readonly name: string;

  @IsInt()
  @Min(1900)
  @Max(new Date().getFullYear())
  readonly yearFormed: number;
  // ... other fields
}
```

### 5. Improved Relationships

- Fixed bidirectional relationships between entities
- Added proper cascade options for foreign keys
- Enhanced join table configurations for many-to-many relationships

### 6. Migration Support

- Created comprehensive migration file for schema updates
- Added migration scripts to package.json
- Set up proper TypeORM data source configuration

## Benefits

### Performance Improvements
- Strategic indexing reduces query execution time
- Proper data types optimize storage
- Efficient relationship configurations

### Data Integrity
- Comprehensive validation at both application and database levels
- Foreign key constraints prevent orphaned records
- Check constraints ensure data quality

### Maintainability
- Clear audit trail for all changes
- Soft deletion preserves data history
- Well-structured DTOs with validation

### Scalability
- Optimized indexes support efficient querying as data grows
- Proper normalization reduces data redundancy
- Flexible enum types allow for easy extension

## Migration Instructions

1. **Backup your existing database** before running migrations
2. Update your environment to disable synchronize in production:
   ```typescript
   synchronize: false // in app.module.ts TypeORM configuration
   ```
3. Run the migration:
   ```bash
   npm run migration:run
   ```
4. Seed the database with sample data:
   ```bash
   npm run seed
   ```

## Available Migration Commands

```bash
# Generate a new migration based on entity changes
npm run migration:generate -- src/migrations/NewMigrationName

# Create an empty migration file
npm run migration:create -- src/migrations/NewMigrationName

# Run pending migrations
npm run migration:run

# Revert the last migration
npm run migration:revert
```

## Future Considerations

### Potential Additional Entities
- **Genre**: Normalize genres instead of using strings
- **Country**: Normalize countries for better data consistency
- **Label**: Separate entity for record labels
- **Venue**: Detailed venue information for events

### Performance Monitoring
- Monitor query performance after implementation
- Consider additional indexes based on actual usage patterns
- Implement database query logging for optimization

### Security Enhancements
- Implement row-level security if needed
- Add data encryption for sensitive fields
- Set up proper backup and recovery procedures

This improved schema provides a solid foundation for the mbands application with better data integrity, performance, and maintainability.
